# Villain-API
Refactored Female SuperVillain code from templates to API endpoints. This app used Javascipt, HTML, CSS, and Python.  The aop removes and adds supervillain trading cards.  Used python modules such as jsonify.  Created a jinja template version of the SuperVillain app in addition to one that uses REST API routes.  Created SQL database to store data. RESTful routing and CRUD was used to design the app.
