# Villain-API
Refactored Female SuperVillain app that used Jinja tempating.  This app built an API Endpoint for the SuperVillain App using Javascipt, HTML, CSS, and Python.  The aop removes and adds supervillain trading cards.  Used python modules such as jsonify.  Created a jinja template version of the SuperVillain app in addition to one that uses REST API routes.  Created SQL database to store data. RESTful routing and CRUD was used to design the app.
